# Create a master Sandbox account

Create an account in our test environment at https://uat.dwolla.com/register. Our Sandbox environment is a mirror of our production environment. When creating your account in the Sandbox environment, Dwolla doesnâ€™t validate any personal identifying information in the registration form, therefore you can either supply fake information or your own identifying information. e.g. address, date of birth, SSN, etc. Do not use other identifying information for another person.
