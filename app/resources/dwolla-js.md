# Dwolla.js

Dwolla.js is a client-side JavaScript library with the primary function of securely transmitting sensitive data (bank account and routing number) from your application's front-end to Dwolla without the data passing through your server. When you attach a bank account to a Dwolla account or white label Customer, use dwolla.js and let Dwolla reduce your risk of handling sensitive data. You will generate a funding sources token, collect the user's bank account information, and call a JavaScript function to send this data to Dwolla.

When you collect and submit the user's bank account information, dwolla.js has built-in validation that will trigger an error if any of the required fields are invalid.
