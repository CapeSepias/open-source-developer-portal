## Traditional accounts

A Traditional account can be established prior to interacting with your application by signing up on dwolla.com, or can be created directly inline with the capture of the user's permission via Dwollaâ€™s OAuth flow. In both of these cases, Dwolla facilitates the onboarding process and (if necessary) additional identity verification.
